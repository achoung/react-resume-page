# resume-page

Here is my [**Resume**](https://achoung.github.io/resume-page).

---
A GitHub Pages powered resume template coded in React using my resume.

The React code has been cleaned up and linted using ESLint with the Airbnb styling guide and has been modified to fit my preference.

The original repository is found [here](https://github.com/tbakerx/react-resume-template).
